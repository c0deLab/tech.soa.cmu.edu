This workshop begins with a tour of the **Digital Fabrication Lab** as well as a discussion of General Laboratory **Policies and Procedures**. We will then move on to an introductory lecture on **Laser Cutting** that will describe file preparation, Rhino/Illustrator workflows, vector/raster objects, and common best practices. In addition to covering equipment use, we will also review safety protocols in order to properly handle a fire emergency.

As part of a hands-on portion of the course, participants will have an opportunity to run through a sample file - exposing printer-specific settings and feeds/speeds. Upon completion of the workshop, you will be able to access and reserve time on the machine by way of our **Reservation System**. If you have any questions prior to your enrollment, feel free to contact José Pertierra-Arrojo at jpertier@andrew.cmu.edu.
