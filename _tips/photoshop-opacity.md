PHOTOSHOP TIP: Some of you already know this, but for those of you who don’t, if you want to change the opacity of one layer, just select that layer and press number keys! No need to click then drag the slider! For example, 3 stands for 30% opacity, 5.5 for 55%. Notice here, 0 stands for 100% and 00 stands for 0% (tricky)! It’s simple but super useful. Give it a try if you haven’t done so :-)
