The site Archive 3D features a database of thousands of objects available for free download. Most of the objects are meshes in 3DS format and include texture maps, so they are ready to use in 3ds Max and are easily translatable to other programs. Not everything is modeled at the same quality, so it might take a little digging to find something that will work, but in the thousands of options on the site, thereâ€™s probably something that fits.
