**FULL-TIME FACULTY RESEARCH IN DFAB**
Note: Student and course work take priority during the Fall and Spring semesters.

To request dFAB access for full-time faculty research, please provide a brief description of your research project including a schedule, string billing code(s), the equipment likely needed, and a list of the individuals that you plan to have working in dFAB on the project. Your proposal will be reviewed by the dFAB Administration in consultation with the SoA Department Head, as necessary.

To help facilitate your request, we recommend submitting your proposal at least one month before your intended start date. To help expedite the process, please use our Full-time Faculty Research Request Form available here: dFAB_FFRRF

Full-time faculty that plan to use dFAB resources as part of their research need to be qualified to use the equipment and/or be able to hire research assistants that are pre-qualified to work in dFAB. It is the responsibility of the faculty member to locate and employ qualified individuals who work with lab equipment on the project. Sufficient levels of training and affiliation with the SoA as a student, faculty member, or research staff are required in advance of the research start date. A one-week long dFAB training course for faculty is available during certain times of the year. Please contact dFAB Administration for the next available training time. The syllabus for the course is available here: SoA dFAB Lab Certification Training for Faculty

While there are no costs associated with the use of the dFAB equipment by full-time faculty, a string billing code is required in advance for all 3D printing materials, store purchases, and equipment damage due to improper use or neglect of the machines.

Hours of access are limited to regular lab hours, dFAB staff will provide monitoring of the lab, but all operational support of the project is the responsibility of the faculty and/or their assistants.

Some resources will be unavailable at times when preventative maintenance is performed.  During this time, access to resources is closed. Notice will be given well in advance, whenever possible.

In preparation for new school years, all summer projects must vacate the lab and associated spaces two weeks before the start of the Fall semester. This includes removing all remaining materials and cleaning any spaces occupied during this time.
