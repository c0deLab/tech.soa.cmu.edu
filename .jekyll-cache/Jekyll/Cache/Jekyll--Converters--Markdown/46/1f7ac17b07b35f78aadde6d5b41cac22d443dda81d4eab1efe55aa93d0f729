<p>tech.soa is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and hosted through <a href="https://github.com/c0deLab/tech.soa.cmu.edu">GitHub</a>. If youâ€™re working on the site, youâ€™ll need to create a Github Account and clone the repo in order to do anything.</p>

<p><strong>The frontend uses the <a href="https://get.foundation/sites/docs/">Foundation</a> framework.</strong> Itâ€™s similar to Bootstrap, Semantic UI, or other similar systems. This site really only uses the frameworkâ€™s <a href="https://get.foundation/sites/docs/grid.html">Grid</a> system, which is a 12-column, nestable Foundation grid.</p>

<p>If you think youâ€™ve found a bug open a issue <a href="https://github.com/c0deLab/tech.soa.cmu.edu/issues">here.</a> You will need a GitHub account to do so. When opening a issue be precise as possible for quickest response. Images / screenshots are great ways to help pass the information along.</p>
