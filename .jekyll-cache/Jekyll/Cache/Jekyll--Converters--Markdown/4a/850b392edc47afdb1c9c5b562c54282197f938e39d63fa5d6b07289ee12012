I"Q<p>This workshop will cover the basics to operating <strong>dFAB’s Vacuum Form</strong>! We’ll begin with a brief discussion on Policies and Procedures for using the equipment, as well as safety protocol, followed by an introduction to making a proper vacuum form mold. This will be an opportunity to re-visit some of the lecture topics discussed during the CNC Routing workshops - particularly mold materiality/finishing and their relationship to the fininshed product. Since this task tends to be time consuming, a sample mold will be ready for participants to obtain hand-on experience using the machine. If you have any questions prior to your enrollment, feel free to contact José Pertierra-Arrojo at <a href="mailto:jpertier@andrew.cmu.edu">jpertier@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.</p>
