<p>tech.soa is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> , and hosted through GitHub. If youâ€™re working on the site, youâ€™ll need to create a Github Account and clone the repo in order to do anything.</p>

<p>If you think youâ€™ve found a bug open a issue <a href="https://github.com/c0deLab/tech.soa.cmu.edu/issues">here.</a> You will need a GitHub account to do so. When opening a issue be precise as possible for quickest response. Images / screenshots are great ways to help pass the information along.</p>
