I"<p>This workshop begins with a tour of the <strong>Digital Fabrication Lab</strong> as well as a discussion of General Lab <strong>Policies and Procedures</strong>. We will then move on to an introductory lecture on <strong>Laser Cutting</strong> that will describe file preparation, Rhino/Illustrator workflows, vector/raster objects, and best practices. In addition to covering equipment use, we will also review safety protocols in order to properly handle a fire emergency.</p>

<p>As part of a hands-on exercise, participants will have an opportunity to run through a sample file - exposing printer-specific settings and laser parameters. Upon completion of the workshop, you will be able to access and reserve time on the machine by way of our <strong>Reservation System</strong>. If you have any questions prior to your enrollment, feel free to contact Jos√© Pertierra-Arrojo at <a href="mailto:jpertier@andrew.cmu.edu">jpertier@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.</p>
