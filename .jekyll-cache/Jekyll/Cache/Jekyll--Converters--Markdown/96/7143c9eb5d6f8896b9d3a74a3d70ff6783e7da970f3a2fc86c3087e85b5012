I"‰<p>This workshop will review <strong>dFABâ€™s</strong> Policies and Procedures for <strong>3D Printing</strong> as well as their printer properties, capabilities, and pricing. We will then move on to the basics of file preparation using <strong>Rhino 3D</strong> - particularly techniques for solving issues related to meshing, file tolerances, units, scale, volume, closed-forms, and stereolithography.</p>

<p>Participants will be given files to identify and remedy file errors in order to develop the necessary modeling dexterity for file submission. Once submission forms are filled out, we will preview a print job and verify printability on printer software. If you have any questions prior to your enrollment, feel free to contact JosÃ© Pertierra-Arrojo at <a href="mailto:jpertier@andrew.cmu.edu">jpertier@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.</p>
