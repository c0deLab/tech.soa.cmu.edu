I"ª<p>Welcome to the documentation for my work in Spring 2020. For whoever works on the site next, I hope this helps tech.soa onboarding. ðŸ˜‡</p>

<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>

<p>tech.soa is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and hosted through <a href="https://github.com/c0deLab/tech.soa.cmu.edu">GitHub</a>. If youâ€™re working on the site, youâ€™ll need to do a few things in order to run the site locally.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a GitHub account and clone the repo on your computer</li>
  <li>Set up a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements">dev environment</a></li>
  <li>Run the site using <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll s</code> (in the terminal or on GitHub command line)</li>
  <li>Edit</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The frontend uses the <a href="https://get.foundation/sites/docs/">Foundation</a> framework.</strong> Itâ€™s similar to Bootstrap, Semantic UI, or other similar systems. This site really only uses the frameworkâ€™s <a href="https://get.foundation/sites/docs/grid.html">Grid</a> system, which is a 12-column, nestable Foundation grid.</p>

<p><strong>Additionally, you may need to learn more about the <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid Coding Language</a></strong> to work with the making/editing how dynamic content works.</p>

<p>If you think youâ€™ve found a bug open a issue <a href="https://github.com/c0deLab/tech.soa.cmu.edu/issues">here.</a> You will need a GitHub account to do so. When opening a issue be precise as possible for quickest response. Images / screenshots are great ways to help pass the information along.</p>
