I"Õ<p><strong>Bring Your Own Laptop Computer:</strong></p>

<p>All SoA students are expected to bring their own laptop computers that are sufficiently powerful for coursework. A mobile and powerful computing capability is an essential part of the current design studio culture. Your laptop should be a vessel to communicate your design ideas and not only for your personal use. Beyond doing the actual design work, you will often use your laptop and an external monitor to present during informal desk critiques and formal reviews. Be prepared to be a versatile communicator with your laptop. In addition, public computer labs managed by the university (not by SoA) are available on campus for students to use.</p>

<p><img src="../img/software/tips.png" alt="alt text" /><strong>Laptop Computer Recommendations:</strong><br />
In order to ensure that your computer is sufficiently powerful to do the computing required of B.Arch students, and to ensure that you get the best possible support from the instructors, SoA, CMU, and the manufacturers, we strongly encourage that you follow the guidelines below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Operating System: Windows 10</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Processor: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Intel 6</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">8-Core CPU</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">i7</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Xeon</code><br />
Avoid low wattage CPUs ending in the letter U.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Memory: 16GB+</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Video Card:<br />
Minimum: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Quadro P1000</code> / <code class="highlighter-rouge">RX 580</code> / <code class="highlighter-rouge">GTX 1060</code><br />
Recommended: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Quadro P3000+</code> / <code class="highlighter-rouge">AMD Vega 20+</code> / <code class="highlighter-rouge">RTX 2070+</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hard Drive: 512GB+ SSD</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Warranty: We recommend only purchasing from brands that offer 3+ year warranties and adding Accidental Damage coverage if available.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When purchasing your computer, please make sure it is at or above the specification.</p>

<p>We also recommend contacting the <a href="https://bookstore.web.cmu.edu/computerstore">Carnegie Mellon Computing Store</a> prior to purchase. They offer various system configurations with educational discounts exclusive to CMU students.</p>

<p><img src="../img/software/warranty.png" alt="alt text" /><strong>Get Extended Warranty</strong></p>

<p>While the campus is safe, it could be a volatile environment with moving parts, bulky models, sleepless nights, accidental spills, drops, and other accidents that could render you unable to proceed with your work. Unless you are an advanced user, hedge against this risk. Purchase and extend as much of the accidental damage warranty you can afford.</p>

<p><img src="../img/software/monitor.png" alt="alt text" /><strong>Monitors Provided</strong><br />
If you have a desk assignment, the school will offer external display monitors with optional articulated mounting arms. These are only for use within SoA studios and must be secured with a lock. The monitors can natively support both <code class="highlighter-rouge">VGA</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">DVI</code> connections. Other connections may be available via adapters (not provided). Monitors can be checked out through the Media Center (CFA 213).</p>

<p><img src="../img/software/mouse.png" alt="alt text" /><strong>Get a Mouse</strong><br />
Using an external computer mouse is necessary in order to take full advantage of most design software packages. Not using one will compromise your productivity and negatively impact your coursework.</p>

<p><img src="../img/software/usb.png" alt="alt text" /><strong>Donâ€™t Rely on External Drives</strong><br />
While it is good practice to use external data storage drives such as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Thumb / Flash / USB drive</code> in an ad hoc or emergency setting, relying on them is very risky. They often break, get infected and get lost. For backing up your work automatically on the cloud, take advantage of <a href="http://tech.soa.cmu.edu/softwares/gsuite.html">free unlimited storage on CMUâ€™s Google Drive.</a></p>
