I"<p>PHOTOSHOP TIP: Some of you already know this, but for those of you who donâ€™t, if you want to change the opacity of one layer, just select that layer and press number keys! No need to click then drag the slider! For example, 3 stands for 30% opacity, 5.5 for 55%. Notice here, 0 stands for 100% and 00 stands for 0% (tricky)! Itâ€™s simple but super useful. Give it a try if you havenâ€™t done so :-)</p>
