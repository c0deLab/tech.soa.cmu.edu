[Zoom](https://www.cmu.edu/computing/services/comm-collab/web-conferencing/zoom/how-to/attend-class.html) is the universityâ€™s primary web conference tool and has been a valuable resource as we transition to remote learning. Zoom meetings can be joined using an invitation link or a Meeting ID that the host is assigned while starting a meeting. It is important to download the Zoom desktop/mobile application in order to gain access to a meeting easily.
