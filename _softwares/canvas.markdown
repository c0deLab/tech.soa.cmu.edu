**Standard Tips**
![alt text](../img/software/tips.png)

Canvas is a cloud-based platform that streamlines all of the digital tools and content required for a more connected learning experience.

- More of its features (e.g. [Peer Review](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10256-4152719640), [Group Discussions](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-13039-415264224), [Group Assignments](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10107-415254248) may be used during the transition.
- Instructors may utilize the PDF markup features of Canvas to provide feedback. Make sure to take the time to review the feedback.
- Submission comments may be a good way to communicate with your instructor.
- Make sure to submit your work as optimized files and/or as required by your instructor.
