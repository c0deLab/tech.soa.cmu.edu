[Modelo](https://modelo.io/) is a no-frills 3D model, PDF, and image communication and markup tool. It can be used to upload Rhino, Revit and Sketchup models for the purpose of design review and discussion.

**Features and Tips**
![alt text](../img/software/features.png)

- Mobile VR capable (Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear).
- Modelo has limited rendering and texture mapping capabilities—but that’s kind of the idea.
- It is great for creating simple walk throughs and interactive presentations, and could potentially be used for a design crit.
- Great tool for handling mixed media in a single project repository.
- Multiple folders can be created in each project repository to simulate different phases of the project.
