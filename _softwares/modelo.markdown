Modelo is a no-frills 3D model, PDF, and image communication and markup tool. It can be used to upload Rhino, Revit and Sketchup models for the purpose of design review and discussion.

**Features**

- Mobile VR capable (Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear).

- Modelo has limited rendering and texture mapping capabilities—but that’s kind of the idea.

- It is great for creating simple walk throughs and interactive presentations, and could potentially be used for a design crit.

- Great tool for handling mixed media in a single project repository.

- Multiple folders can be created in each project repository to simulate different phases of the project.

- If you’ve received an invitation, please sign up as soon as you can.

- If you haven't, email a request for license to [eddymankim@cmu.edu](mailto:eddymankim@cmu.edu).
