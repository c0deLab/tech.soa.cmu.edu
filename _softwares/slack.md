![alt text](../img/software/tips.png)

- Technical support is crowd sourced here.

- Works great with mobile devices because you can see the notifications.

- Channels can be requested / created for specific topics, organizations, and activities. 

- Great way to stay connected with the school community for non-course / non-FERPA protected content (see [Privacy Policy](https://slack.com/privacy-policy)).
