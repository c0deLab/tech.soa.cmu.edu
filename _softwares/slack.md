Slack is a community-oriented massive chat platform that allows for collaboration and communication with unlimited channels.

- Technical support could be crowd-sourced here.

- Works great with mobile devices because you can see the notifications.

- Channels can be requested / created for specific topics, organizations, and activities. 

- Great way to stay connected with the school community for non-course / non-FERPA protected content (see [Privacy Policy](https://slack.com/privacy-policy)).
