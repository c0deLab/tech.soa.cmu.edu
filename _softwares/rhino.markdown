1. Download [Rhino 6](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-windows/6/latest).

2. Connect to [CMU VPN](https://www.cmu.edu/computing/services/endpoint/network-access/vpn/how-to/).

3. Install and choose to license with `The Zoo` (NOT cloud zoo, the regular zoo).

4. Use this server information: `rhino.andrew.cmu.edu`

5. The only limitation is that 90 people can use the licenses at the same time.
