Rhino 6 is the School of Architecture's primary 3D modeling software. At present, there are 90 network licenses owned by the school/university that are available.

  **How to use the Rhino 6 school license**

  - Download [Rhino 6](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-windows/6/latest).

  - Connect to [CMU VPN](https://www.cmu.edu/computing/services/endpoint/network-access/vpn/how-to/).

  - Install and choose to license with The Zoo (NOT cloud zoo, the regular zoo).

  - Use this server information: rhino.andrew.cmu.edu.

  - The only limitation is that 90 people can use the licenses at the same time.

*Note: This instruction also works for [Rhino 7 WIP](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/wip)!*
